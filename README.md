Idea: Through this app, we intend to provide a platform for the easy selection of the preferable book for the reader.

A new Flutter project. It is basically an app having specific Login functionlity. Only the person with particular email id and password can login to the app. LogIn Id:"test@email.com" password:"test"

Getting Started
After login, the home page will appear on the screen having list of all the books present in the database. Through the search button, the person will type the required book name and after selecting the required book, the whole detail of that book will appear on the screen.

We will also add review,rating and favourite functionality here.

P.S:It is just a prototype.
